    <p>
        I am a 22-year-old college graduate. I Graduated from Georgia Gwinnett College with a Bachelor of Science and majored in software development. While pursuing my degree I was able to learn programming languages like Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python and other skills such as HTML/CSS, MySQL, OracleSQL. 
        I was able to put these skills to use working on several group projects for my college courses. 
        This also helped me learn other skills like Git, GitHub, React.JS, JIRA. 
        I was able to gain lots of experience working in a team environment and working with other people on these projects. 
        I was able to work with software methodologies like waterfall and Agile/scrum during these projects.
        While working on these projects, I would always find myself leading the UI/UX and I loved the challenges that presented themselves with it.
        I’ve always found the experience of creating user friendly interfaces challenging but rewarding.
